<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Convection is present in every star, and in many planets as well. It transports heat, mixes material, and in most cases is responsible for building the magnetic fields we observe at the surfaces of these objects. 

In this project we will explore the equations describing convection in an idealised context.

<p>
We will begin by considering the linearised equations and study when convection onsets in a fluid. This involves studying an eigenvalue problem, the simplest of which can be solved analytically. For more complex cases, involving more realistic physical effects, students would be encouraged to write a numerical code to examine these cases.

<p>
Depending on particular interests, there is scope for this project to consider different physical effects on the convection, e.g., rotation, magnetic field or different geometries. Alternatively, it is possible to extend the problem into the nonlinear regime and to study aspects of the convection in the nonlinear regime. This would involve solving a set of PDEs numerically.
